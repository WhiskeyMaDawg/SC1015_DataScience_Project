### Description  
Music streaming has been an integral part of our lives. There is a whopping 406 millions users worldwide who are using spotify for music streaming. With this amount of user counts, streaming music platforms are using data collected by consumer interaction in an effort to hone their algorithms, improve user experiences, target audiences with ads, and make overall better-informed business decisions. 

### Problem Definition  
Using the data available,  
- How important are the attributes in predicting popularity?  
- Whether there are any attributes that can be tweaked to increase popularity?  

### Dataset
Spotify stores a lot of songs data in its database. We make use of its Spotify API and the python Spotipy package to access and extract the songs data that we need in the playlist. Examples such as the song's titles, artists and numerous attributes of the songs.
